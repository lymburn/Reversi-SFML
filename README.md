# Reversi-with-C-SFML

Reversi, also known as Othello, is a 2 player board game. Players play as either black or white and place pieces on the board until either the board is filled or one player has no colors left. The game is simple at glance but has sophisticated strategies underneath. More information on the game can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi. 


This project is a recreation of the Reversi game using C++ and the SFML library. As my first C++ game, I used to it as a way to help me reinforce basic concepts (control flow, functions, 2D arrays) as well as object orientated programming concepts. I used Paintbrush for very simple graphics and focussed more on the technical aspects.

I also uploaded a short youtube video demonstrating the gameplay. Feel free to check it out at https://youtu.be/ZNVPVC2AYI0
